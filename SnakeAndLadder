All the players will start from 1
Players will roll die and encounters snake or ladder
one who reaches 100 wins
die rolls based out of 6
if they throw more than 100 then it should not move

Assumptions:
No snake at 100
Snakes and ladders do not form infinite loop
there wont be multiple ladder and snake at same position
definitely a player can win
